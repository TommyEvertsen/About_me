              Game devlopment is a field i really love but dont have enough free
              time to pursue. I wish i could have more time to learn more about
              this and create the games of my imagination.

              When i was younger i created 2 videogames wich each took around 2
              years to complete. It was a very enjoyable experience for me, i
              could use endless creativity in creating what i wanted. Making
              games is very time consuming
